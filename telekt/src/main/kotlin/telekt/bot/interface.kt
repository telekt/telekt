     * Notes
     *   1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.
     *   2. In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate offset after each server response.
     *
     * @param offset Identifier of the first update to be returned.
     * Must be greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of previously received updates.
     * By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned.
     * An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with an offset higher than its update_id.
     * The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue.
     * All previous updates will forgotten.
     *
     * @param limit Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1—100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.
     *
     * @param timeout Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling.
     * Should be positive, short polling should be used for testing purposes only.
     *
     * @param allowedUpdates List the types of updates you want your bot to receive.
     * For example, specify [“message”, “edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive updates of these types.
     * See [Update] for a complete list of available update types.
     * Specify an empty list to receive all updates regardless of type (default).
     * If not specified, the previous setting will be used.
     * Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the getUpdates,
     * so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.
